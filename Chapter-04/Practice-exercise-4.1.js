// Practice exercise 4.1

// 1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
let variable = true;

// 2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
console.log(variable);

/* 3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a 
message to the console, using the following syntax:
if(myVariable){
//action
} 
 */
if (variable){
    console.log("The variable is true")
} 

/* 4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable 
to check whether the condition is not true, and create a message 
that will be printed to the console in that instance. You should 
have two if statements, one with an ! and the other without. You 
could also use an if and an else statement insteadâ€”experiment! */
if(!variable){
    console.log("The variable is onot true")
}



/* 5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result 
changes. */
